I'm **Stefan**, a first-year Computer Engineering student at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. I enjoy jumping into projects out of curiosity and then figuring things out through hands-on implementation as I go. So far, I have learned enough to become somewhat proficient in Java, as well as gained a brief understanding of how microcontrollers work and how to utilize them.

**Some stuff I built:**
- [Arduino UNO Chess Clock](https://github.com/kottbullepizza/Arduino-UNO-Chess-Clock) - A physical, functional chess clock built using only an Arduino Starter kit.
- [Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/kottbullepizza/Unbeatable-TicTacToe) - A Tic Tac Toe GUI, game-playing engine and simulator for large-scale tracking and testing.
- To be continued...

**Fun facts:**
- I hold an offical FIDE chess rating over 2100 along with 2600 on chess.com
- I speak russian fluently (Swedish-born with Ukrainian roots)
- Star Wars I watched have not
